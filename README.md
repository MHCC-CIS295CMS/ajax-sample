AJAX Sample
===========

This is a simple AJAX sample which builds an XMLHttpRequest object and queries a php script
on the server side for "AJAX Sugest" style functionality.

This sample teaches the basics of AJAX communication.

Many javascript libraries, such as jquery, have this functionality built in. However, I use this sample to
help teach my students the fundamentals of AJAX. Once you understand the process, use a javascript library
for ease of use.
